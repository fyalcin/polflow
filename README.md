# PolFlow - Automated Modeling of Polarons

**PolFlow** is an automated workflow package for modeling polarons within density functional theory (DFT). It streamlines all computational steps required to identify, analyze, and interpret polaronic configurations in complex materials, leveraging machine learning to accelerate predictions and enable large-scale studies.

## Abstract

Polarons are widespread in functional materials and are key to device performance in several technological applications. However, their effective impact on material behavior remains elusive, as condensed matter studies struggle to capture their intricate interplay with atomic defects in the crystal.

In this work, we present an automated workflow for modeling polarons within density functional theory (DFT). Our approach enables a fully automatic identification of the most favorable polaronic configurations in the system. Machine learning techniques accelerate predictions, allowing for an efficient exploration of the defect-polaron configuration space. We apply this methodology to Nb-doped TiOâ‚‚ surfaces, providing new insights into the role of defects in surface reactivity.

Using CO adsorbates as a probe, we find that Nb doping has minimal impact on reactivity, whereas oxygen vacancies contribute significantly depending on their local arrangement via the stabilization of polarons on the surface atomic layer. Our package streamlines the modeling of charge trapping and polaron localization with high efficiency, enabling systematic, large-scale investigations of polaronic effects across complex material systems.
